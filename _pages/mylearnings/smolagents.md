Hugging Face's **smolagents** is a new Python library that simplifies the creation of AI agents, making them more accessible to developers.

In this blog, I will introduce you to the smolagents library, explain why it's useful, and guide you through a demo project to showcase its capabilities.

### **What Is Hugging Faceâ€™s Smolagents?**


AI agent frameworks are often criticized for:
1. Building too many layers of abstraction, making them rigid and challenging to debug.
2. Focusing on "workflows" rather than dynamic agent collaboration.

**Smolagents**, however, offers:
- Minimal abstractions.
- Code Agents that define actions in Python code snippets rather than JSON/text format.
- Seamless integration with the Hugging Face ecosystem (e.g., Hugging Face Hub, Transformers library, and proprietary models like OpenAI's GPT).
- Straightforward customization of tools with minimal effort.
