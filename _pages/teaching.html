    Machine learning models are everywhere, and their role in society may increase as they become more popular and influential.
     At the same time, recent work has shown that LLMs can simulate and predict human behavior remarkably well.
     Thus, understanding and steering the behavior of such systems can amplify their benefits, mitigate their harms,
      and increase our understanding of human behavior. This seminar course aims to facilitate publishable student 
      research on these broad topics. Coursework is a mix of readings and a research project.
